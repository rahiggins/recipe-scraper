            -- If the recipe name is not consistent with the recipe URL, look for a redirect. This processing was moved from function nameDiffersFromURL to sectionScrape.
            -- Use curl via execSync to look for redirects, instead of the request or needle package.
            -- Create table HTML for the article and any recipes. This processing was moved from function artScrape to sectionScrape.
