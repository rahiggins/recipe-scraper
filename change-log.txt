    Added support for past years. The application now presents a choice between
    processing the current year of past years.  If the current year is chosen, the
    application proceeds as before.  If past years is chosen, a window soliciting
    the year is displayed, and then the NewDays function and insert.php are invoked.

    - index.html and renderer.js were renamed to current-index.html and current-render.js
    - index.html was changed to present 'current' and 'past' buttons and to
        require index-renderer.js
    - index-renderer.js was added to direct index.js to open a browser window for
        either current.html or past.html
    - past.html and past-renderer.js were added
    - functions NewDays, addMsg, remvAllMsg were moved from renerer.js to lib.js
    - the 'insert-closed' and 'invoke-insert' ipcRenderer statements were moved 
        to lib.js as function Insert
